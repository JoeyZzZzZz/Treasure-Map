    Re-hunting a run after the retirement rewrites its instances' origin to 'unknown', which is
    what this simulates. Two things have to hold and they are different claims:

    * breadth can only go UP. The clause admits more rows, never fewer — if it ever went down, the
      predicate would have started excluding something it did not before.
    * it goes up by AT MOST the distinct fingerprints that were being excluded, per pattern. Adding
      rows to a COUNT DISTINCT adds at most the number of distinct new values.

    ★ Per PATTERN, not summed across them. The summed delta can EXCEED the globally-distinct count
    of excluded fingerprints, because one pseudocode_hash can sit under several patterns and be
    counted once in each — measured on the real atlas at the time of writing: +429 summed against
    424 globally-distinct, so an aggregate bound stated that way is simply not an upper bound. The
    per-pattern form is the one that is arithmetically true.

    MUTATION (must go RED): change the origin clause to admit a different set (e.g. drop 'custom',
    or exclude 'unknown') — the count then moves in a way neither bound allows."""
